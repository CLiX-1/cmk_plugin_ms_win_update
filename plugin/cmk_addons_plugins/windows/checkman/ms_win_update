description:
 This check monitors pending Windows updates on Windows systems. It processes
 data collected by the {ms_win_update.ps1} agent plugin.

 The check evaluates the number of pending updates and can be configured with
 warning and critical thresholds. By default, 1 pending update triggers a
 {WARN} state and 5 pending updates trigger a {CRIT} state.

 Updates can be filtered using regular expression patterns to exclude specific
 updates from the pending count. Ignored updates are still reported in the
 service details but do not affect the service state.

 You must deploy the {ms_win_update.ps1} agent plugin to Windows hosts
 to collect update information.

discovery:
 One service named {Windows update} is created on each Windows host where
 the agent plugin is deployed.
